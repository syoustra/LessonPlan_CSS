            <h4>Lesson Overview:</h4>

            <p>Writing code is a series of instructions, organized in a structure. Students will follow the instructions in the <em>Treehouse Club - CSS</em> videos and in their Workspace to edit the structure and style of their web page. (Workspaces is the local development environment built into the Treehouse site. Please see more information about Workspace in the 'Background and Information' section.) At the end of the lesson, students should be able to publish their first web page on a (non sharable) web browser using Workspaces.</p>

            <p>To accomplish this they are going to use two special programming languages, HTML and CSS.  HTML will build the structure of the web page, and CSS will style the web page. Students will be given everything necessary to publish their first web page in the Workspace, the student’s job it to edit the content in the template.</p>

            <h4>Background and Information:</h4>
            
            <p>CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language, like HTML. Along with the HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging web pages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications. </p> 

            <p>By using the Treehouse coding tool Workspace, the content students create will never be released on the Internet. Students will only be able to view their code in the browser as long as the Workspace is open, once they close their workspace, the content becomes unavailable. Once the coding window is closed, the webpage will not exist on the internet.</p>
            
            <p>Workspaces is a robust text editor.  Which means it's a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.  Workspaces is similar to a word processor application like Word or Pages, only instead of understanding English, Spanish, or French, Workspaces understands computer languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, and Python.</p>

        <h4>Lesson Plan: Estimated time  ~ 60 minutes</h4>
        <article>
            <h5>1. Connection to prior-knowledge: 3-5 minutes</h5>
            <p>Ask the students about what a designer does and what they know of what's been designed. Write their responses on the whiteboard. Example responses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A designer is someone that picks out fabrics and patterns for clothes.</li>
                    <li>A designer is an artist.</li>
                    <li>The border around Facebook has been designed, it's blue and the news feed is in one row down the middle of the screen. </li> 
                    <li>The font or colors someone uses on a website is designed.</li>
                </ul>
        </article>

        <article> 
            <h5>2. Introduction to project: 5 minutes</h5>
            <p>Let the students know they are going to be making our first web page. It's going to be their personal profile, with information about them and what they like.  The most important part of their web site and this lesson is to show who they are by the way they design and style their web page using CSS. </p>
        </article>

        <article> 
            <h5>3. Code Requirements: 2 minutes</h5>
            <p>HTML should include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Picture (doesn't need to be of your face)</li>
                <li>Name and location</li>
                <li>Answers to two questions of your choice</li>
            </ul>
            <p>CSS should include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Top bar color</li>
                <li>Background color</li>
                <li>Image styling</li>
                <li>Text styling for the name, location, questions, and answers</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <article> 
            <h5>4. Coding exercise: 40 minutes</h5>
            <p>Opening computers, log on to Treehouse, and locate Treehouse Club - CSS lesson in the library.</p>
            <p>Project or individually watch the first video for <em>My First Web Page</em>.</p>
            <p>Have students open up the Workspaces by clicking the blue button that says ‘Launch Workspaces’ next to the video.</p>
            <p>Students edit the pre-written code in the Workspace.
            Remind students to save their work and preview it in the browser frequently during the editing process.</p> 
        </article>

        <article> 
            <h5>5. Share out: 10 minutes</h5>
            <p>Incentivize completion by scheduling time at the end of class for students to share what they have made with the class.</p>
            <p>This can be achieved in a number of ways. A few suggestions include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Project projects at the front of the class.
                <li>Gallery walk, where students leave their computers open and walk around the room.</li>
                <li>Table or pair share, allowing students to talk about what they did in more depth with a smaller number of students.</li>
            </ul>
