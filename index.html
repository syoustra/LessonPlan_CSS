            <h4>Lesson Overview:</h4>

            <p>Writing code is a series of instructions, organized in a structure. Similar to baking, you can put a baking pan in the oven before mixing the ingredients and putting the ingredients in the pan, but you won’t have much to show for yourself after baking your pan for 20 minutes. The same is true with code, you must do step A before step B and so on. Once proficient, you can get fancy with your ingredients and can even experiment with timing, but you must know there is always a process.</p>

            <p>In HTML code, you first ingredients are an opening doctype <!DOCTYPE html> and an html opening and closing tag <html></html>. Between the html tags, you have two main sections, the head <head></head> and the body <body></body>.  The head and body each hold specific things, that I go over in detail in the videos. In the end, your students will publish a story they’ve written in a (completely private and non sharable) web browser.</p>

            <p>Below is an example of how to write HTML code. By copying this code into Workspace and filling in the appropriate information into the title, h1 and p tag, your story will show up when you view it in the browser.<p>

            <h4>Background and Information:</h4>
            
            <p>HTML is one of the most commonly used web development languages used around the world. HTML describes the structure of a website along with cues for presentation, which is why it’s considered a “markup language” rather than a “programming language”. HTML is built on elements, consisting of tags; elements are individual components of an HTML document and tags are written between angle brackets ( ie. <code>&#60;h1&#62;&#60;/h1&#62;</code> ).</p> 

            <p>By using the Treehouse coding tool Workspace, the content students create will never be released on the Internet. Students will only be able to view their code in the browser as long as the Workspace is open, once they close their workspace, the content becomes unavailable. Just to be clear, once the coding window is closed, the webpage will not exist on the internet.</p>

        <h4>Lesson Plan: Estimated time  ~ 60 minutes</h4>
        <article>
            <h5>1. Connection to prior-knowledge: 3 minutes</h5>
            <p>Ask the students how they have been taught to write a story. Example questions: “How do you format a piece of writing?” Write their responses on the whiteboard.</p>

            <p>Example responses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Title in bold letters at the top of the page.</li>
                    <li>Name and date in the upper right hand corner.</li>
                    <li>Align text on the left margin.</li> 
                    <li>Indent the beginning of each paragraph.</li>
                </ul>
        </article>

        <article> 
            <h5>2. Introduction to project: 2 minutes</h5>
            <p>Let the students know that after a 20 minute writing exercise, they are going to “publish the story on the internet” by creating a web page. To do this, they are going to use the computer language HTML. For this first lesson they will fill out an HTML template that has examples for where to put their title, author, and story in the HTML document. You can also let them know that there are comprehensive video lessons if they want detailed instruction.</p>
        </article>

        <article> 
            <h5>3. Writing exercise: 20 minutes.</h5>
            <p>Stories should include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Title and author</li>
                <li>At least 2 paragraphs</li>
                <li>Students should write on a computer to expedite the next activity, however they can always rewrite their story into the Workspace.</li>
                <li>Choose a topic, theme, or allow the students to work freely.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <article> 
            <h5>4. Coding exercise: 25 minutes</h5>
            <p>Project or individually watch the first video for Publish a Story.</p>
            <p>Have students open up the Workspace by clicking the blue button that says ‘Launch Workspace’ next to the video.</p>
            <p>Students edit the pre-written code in the Workspace with their title, author, and story.
            Remind students to save their work and preview it in the browser frequently during the editing process.</p> 
        </article>

        <article> 
            <h5>5. Share out: 10 minutes</h5>
            <p>Incentivize completion by scheduling time at the end of class for students to share what they have made with the class.</p>
            <p>This can be achieved in a number of ways. A few suggestions include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Project projects at the front of the class.
                <li>Gallery walk, where students leave their computers open and walk around the room.</li>
                <li>Table or pair share, where the students can talk about what they did in more depth with a smaller number of students.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Classroom management:</h4>
        <ol> 
            <li>After 20 quiet minutes of writing, and the introductory video, allow students to walk around and help others.</li>
            <li>Publicly acknowledge students for knowing how to do different aspects of the project. This way students will know who to ask, when they have the same question.</li>
            <li>Provide headphones for students who prefer to use the step-by-step instructional videos.</li> 
        </ol>
